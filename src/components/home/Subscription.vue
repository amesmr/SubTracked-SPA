      <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">SubTracked is designed to help you 
          keep track of all of your subscriptions and show you where your money goes each month. 
          It helps you keep track of when free trials are about to end so that you can remember to unsubscribe before
           it starts charging you. The ultimate goal of SubTracked is to help subtract unwanted subscriptions and charges
            from your monthly expenses.</p>
